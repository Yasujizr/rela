# What is **RecursiveLaughter?**
**RecursiveLaughter** is a Survival-Sandbox-Browser-Game, which should run on pretty much any device with an Internet-Browser. It's main strenghts are the high Accessibility and the general Simplicity.

# Getting Started
**RecursiveLaughter** works both offline and online. So, you can either just run the _index.html_ file on your device, or host the whole Project on a server.
And that's it.

# Author / Supporter
- **unrealGuthrie**, as the *GUY-FOR-LITERALLY-EVERYTHING*

Of course, we're always looking for some more Contributors. So, if you have some interesting ideas or want to add new features yourself, then contact us via  Discord.
But we also need some money. That's why we created a Patreon-Page (https://www.patreon.com/rela)
